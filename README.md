## ðŸ”Ž Abstract (short)
We designed and built an **H-frame, coaxial-quad (X8) UAV** with an integrated **sprayer module** to clean **highâ€‘rise building facades** and **solar panels**. The platform uses a **Pixhawk 2.4.8** flight controller, supports **pilot-in-the-loop** assisted modes (Loiter, Altâ€‘Hold, RTL), and carries a **1â€¯L tank** with a **diaphragm pump** (~**5â€¯L/min**) and **servoâ€‘swept nozzles** for wide coverage. In testing, the system achieved **~6 minutes** flight time with a **3.5â€¯kg payload** (total takeoff mass ~**6â€¯kg**). We validated autonomous hover and manual windowâ€‘cleaning missions, demonstrating feasibility of aerial cleaning with Hâ€‘frame stability and payload distribution advantages.

> Full details and evaluation are in **`/docs/B-08 Final Report.pdf`**.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- **Airframe:** Hâ€‘frame, coaxialâ€‘quad (X8)
- **FCU:** Pixhawk 2.4.8 (ArduPilot stack)
- **Propulsion:** BLDC + ESCs (X8 coaxial layout)
- **Payload:** 1â€¯L tank, diaphragm pump (~5â€¯L/min), dual sweeping servos
- **Comms/GCS:** Mission Planner
- **Onboard Algorithms:** PID/EKF (ArduPilot), motorâ€‘mixing for X8
- **Materials:** Carbonâ€‘fiber tubes, custom frame components

## ðŸ“Œ Key Specifications
| Subsystem | Spec |
|---|---|
| Frame | Hâ€‘frame (industrial stability & payload distribution) |
| Configuration | Coaxial X8 |
| Flight Controller | Pixhawk 2.4.8 |
| Battery | Highâ€‘C LiPo (per report BOM) |
| Payload | Sprayer: 1â€¯L tank + diaphragm pump (~5â€¯L/min) + 2Ã— servos |
| Tested Flight Time | ~6â€¯min at 3.5â€¯kg payload (â‰ˆ6â€¯kg AUW) |
| Modes | Loiter, Altâ€‘Hold, RTL failsafe |
| Mission Types | Autonomous hover, manual facade cleaning |

## ðŸ§ª Results (from the report)
- **Autonomous hover:** Stable at **3â€¯m AGL** with GPS lock.  
- **Manual window clean:** Demonstrated sweeping spray coverage and attitude stability.  
- **Logs:** GPS track, altitude, voltage, attitude over time, and airspeed plots.

(See the *Results and Analysis* chapter in the PDF for figures and tables.)

## ðŸ§­ Why Hâ€‘frame?
Hâ€‘frames offer **better payload placement and stability** (especially with bulky or sliding loads) and handle **COG shifts** and **crosswinds** more gracefully than compact Xâ€‘framesâ€”ideal for cleaning tasks where the sprayer mass and fluid dynamics change during flight.
