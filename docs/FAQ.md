# FAQ

**Q: Why H‑frame over X‑frame?**  
Better payload spread and stability when the mass **moves or sloshes**.

**Q: Can I do this with a hexacopter instead?**  
Yes, but X8 keeps the footprint compact with similar thrust and decent redundancy.

**Q: Do I need custom firmware?**  
No. Stock **ArduPilot** with proper X8 setup and basic tuning is enough for the demo.

**Q: How big should the batteries be?**  
Size for **burst current** (pump spikes + eight motors). Use high‑C packs and monitor sag.
